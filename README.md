# FEEDNeT-A-Feature-Enhanced-Encoder-Decoder-LSTM-Network-for-Nuclei-Instance-Segmentation
This paper first introduces a novel model, named FEEDNet, for accurately segmenting the nuclei in HE stained WSIs. FEEDNet is an encoder-decoder network that uses LSTM units and “feature enhancement blocks” (FE-blocks). Our proposed FE-block avoids the loss of location information incurred by pooling layers by concatenating the downsampled version of the original image to preserve pixel intensities. FEEDNet uses an LSTM unit to capture multi-channel representations compactly
